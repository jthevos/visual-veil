# visual-veil

Visual Veil connects visual input from a Microsoft Kinect 2.0, and sends the
data to a MIT Processing Sketch that draws based on your movements.

This currently only runs on windows.

To get started from scratch, follow these steps:

1. If you do not have node.js and the node package manager (NPM) installed on your machine, install them here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm. You can also use homebrew: `brew install node` and `brew install npm`.
2. Clone this repository.
3. cd into the visual-veil directory.
4. run `npm install` to install all project dependencies.
5. Lastly, run the launch script: `launch`
